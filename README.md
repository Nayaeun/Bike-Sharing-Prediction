# Bike Sharing Prediction

## Introduction
This project explores the dynamics of bike sharing in Seoul, leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques to optimize bike rental systems for enhanced mobility and accessibility. Through in-depth analysis of rental patterns, weather conditions, and user behavior, we aim to uncover insights that drive informed decision-making and contribute to the evolution of urban transportation solutions. Join us on this journey as we delve into the intersection of data science and urban mobility, paving the way for smarter, more sustainable transportation networks in Seoul.

## Objectives
1. To analyze Seoul's bike-sharing data for insights into usage patterns, guiding strategic decisions on resource allocation and service expansion.
2. To enhance data quality through advanced preprocessing techniques, facilitating accurate predictive modeling for operational optimization.
3. To identify and deploy the most effective machine learning models for predicting bike rental demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
4. To fine-tune model parameters for maximum accuracy and stability, aligning with business objectives of optimizing operational efficiency.
5. To extract actionable insights from the data, informing strategic initiatives aimed at improving customer experience and driving business growth.

## Methodology
### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
* Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Seoul bike-sharing dataset to uncover rental patterns, hourly trends, and correlations with weather conditions.
* Employed advanced feature engineering techniques to preprocess the dataset, including encoding categorical variables, handling multicollinearity, and removing unnecessary features identified during EDA.

### Model Selection and Optimization:
* Explored a diverse range of machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and Light GBM, to identify the most suitable model for predicting bike rental counts.
* Implemented hyperparameter tuning strategies to optimize the selected model's performance, achieving high levels of predictive accuracy and generalization capability.

### Insights Generation and Business Strategy:
* Derived actionable insights from the analysis, identifying key factors influencing bike rental demand such as temperature, seasonality, and weather conditions.
* Translated insights into strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing bike station locations, maintenance scheduling, and service availability to meet peak demand efficiently and drive business growth.

## Results
### Bike Sharing Demand Management:
* Station Expansion: Open additional stations near workplaces and colleges to cater to the majority of rentals for daily commutes.
* Peak Hours Consideration: Plan for extra bikes during peak rental hours, particularly 7–9 am and 5–6 pm.
* Night Maintenance: Schedule bike maintenance activities at night to minimize disruptions, as bike usage is low during nighttime.

### Rental Patterns:
* Working Day vs. Non-working Day: Two distinct rental patterns observed, with higher rental counts during peak office hours on working days and more uniform counts across the day on non-working days.
* Hour of the Day: Bike rental count correlates strongly with time, reaching peak levels during office commute hours on working days.

### Environmental Factors:
* Temperature: Rental counts peak between 32 to 36 degrees Celsius, indicating a preference for biking in moderate to high temperatures.
* Season: Highest bike rentals observed in Spring (July to September) and Summer (April to June) seasons, with lower counts in Winter (January to March).
* Weather and Humidity: Bike rental counts highest on clear days and decrease with increasing humidity.

### Model Selection:
After exploring various models, Light GBM was chosen for its superior predictive performance in estimating rental bike counts. Rigorous hyperparameter tuning led to a training R2 score of approximately 99.7% and a test R2 score of 95.9%, demonstrating the model's accuracy and reliability.

### Limitations and Future Directions
While the model shows promising results, it's important to acknowledge limitations due to the time-dependent nature of certain variables. Continuous monitoring and adaptation of the model are essential to ensure its effectiveness as the field of machine learning evolves.
  
## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provides valuable insights into managing bike-sharing demand in Seoul. The analysis suggests practical solutions for optimizing bike station locations, considering peak rental hours, and efficient maintenance scheduling. The selected Light GBM model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities, with the potential for further improvement with additional data. The project's findings contribute to the ongoing evolution of the field, emphasizing the importance of staying informed in the rapidly advancing domain of machine learning.
